<h2>Bio</h2>

I am a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) in Montreal, where my research focuses on automating Single Event Upset mitigation for FPGA Zynq UltraScale+ platforms under the supervision of Prof. Claude Thibeault. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Isfahan University of Technology in Iran, where I developed a strong foundation in digital design and hardware systems. My expertise spans FPGA development, ASIC design, and embedded systems, with hands-on experience in hardware description languages including Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL. I am passionate about advancing computing systems and innovation in semiconductor technology.
