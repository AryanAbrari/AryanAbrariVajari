## Bio
I am a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) in Montreal, where my research focuses on automating Single Event Upset mitigation for FPGA Zynq UltraScale+ platforms under the supervision of Prof. Claude Thibeault. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Isfahan University of Technology in Iran, where I developed a strong foundation in digital design and hardware systems. My expertise spans FPGA development, ASIC design, and embedded systems, with hands-on experience in hardware description languages including Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL. I am passionate about advancing computing systems and innovation in semiconductor technology.

I am deeply passionate about digital electronics and FPGA technology, which represent the cutting edge of modern computing. Semiconductors are the foundation of virtually every technological advancement—from artificial intelligence and autonomous systems to space exploration and quantum computing.

## About Me

I was born and raised in Rasht, a cloudy city in northern Iran with beautiful nature around. I then moved to Isfahan to study my Bachelor at IUT. after completing my bachelor, I moved to Montreal to persue my M.Sc degree at ETS. I have been in the city of festivals and events, Montreal, since 2022. The nightlife and great vibe of Montreal remind me of my hometown, Rasht. 
Besides the studies, I like playing violin, reading books in economics and politics and of course, talking about them.
